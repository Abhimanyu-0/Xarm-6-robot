# Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for controlling the Xarm6 robot. The project covers various aspects, including forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, numerical inverse kinematics, Jacobians, dynamics, and trajectory generation.

## Introduction
This code serves as a practical implementation of robotic kinematics and dynamics, focusing on the application of forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, workspace analysis, and Jacobian matrices. Specifically designed for the xarm6 machete robot, the code aims to provide a comprehensive tool for understanding and applying theoretical concepts from a robotics class to real-world scenarios.

## System Requirements
Python environment with necessary libraries NumPy, Matplotlib, Pybullet.
